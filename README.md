Abstract
--------
This study presents the development of a semi-automated processing chain for OBIA urban land-cover and land-use classification. The processing chain is implemented in Python and relies on existing the open-source software GRASS GIS and R. The complete tool chain is available in open-access and adaptable to specific user needs. For automation purpose, we developed two GRASS GIS add-ons allowing (1) to optimize segmentation parameters in an unsupervised manner and (2) to classify remote sensing data using several individual machine learning classifiers or their predictions combination through voting-schemes. We tested the performance and the transferability of the processing chain using sub-metric multispectral and height data on two very different urban environments: Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso in sub-Saharan Africa and Li√®ge, Belgium in Western Europe. Using a hierarchical classification scheme, overall accuracy reached are about 0.80 at the second level (9 and 11 classes) and 0.93 at the first level (5 classes).
